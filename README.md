# Power-BI-Dashboards
Power BI is a data visualization and business intelligence tool created by Microsoft. It allows users to connect to multiple data sources, including Excel spreadsheets, databases, and cloud services, and then create interactive visualizations, charts, and reports to help analyze and share data insights.

Using Power BI, users can create dashboards that display real-time data from multiple sources in a single view. These dashboards can be customized with a variety of visualizations, such as charts, maps, and tables, to help users gain insights into trends and patterns.

Power BI also includes features for data modeling, data preparation, and data transformation, which allows users to clean and shape data to make it more usable for analysis. Additionally, Power BI integrates with other Microsoft tools, such as Excel and Azure, to provide a comprehensive suite of business intelligence solutions.
